Source code for the WarehousePG Database documentation is shared between WarehousePG Database and
VMware WarehousePG. Some features of VMware WarehousePG are not present in the
open source WarehousePG Database code but are described in the WarehousePG Database documentation. 

The term "VMware WarehousePG" refers to VMware's commercial, supported product offering that is 
based on open source WarehousePG Database.  "VMware WarehousePG" is used in this documentation when 
describing features that are available only in the commercial offering. The term "WarehousePG
Database" refers to features available in open source WarehousePG Database (and in the commercial VMware 
WarehousePG product). Commercial support for "WarehousePG Database" is offered by VMware as "WarehousePG Database by VMware."

The following is a list of VMware WarehousePG features that are not provided or supported in open
source WarehousePG Database, but may be documented or referenced in this documentation.

- Code to produce the VMware WarehousePG binary installer packages is not included
in the open source WarehousePG Database repository. 

- WarehousePG Database does not include EMC DD Boost integration. Backing up to an EMC Data
Domain appliance is only supported when the Data Domain system is mounted as an NFS share on
the WarehousePG hosts. 

- WarehousePG Database does not include Symantec NetBackup integration. 

- The deprecated <codeph>gpcheck</codeph> management utility and its replacement <codeph>gpsupport</codeph> are only supported with VMware WarehousePG. 

- Suggestions to contact VMware Technical Support in this documentation are intended only for VMware WarehousePG customers.
