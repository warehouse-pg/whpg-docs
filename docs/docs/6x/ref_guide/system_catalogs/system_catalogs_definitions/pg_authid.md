The `pg_authid` table contains information about database authorization identifiers (roles). A role subsumes the concepts of users and groups. A user is a role with the `rolcanlogin` flag set. Any role (with or without `rolcanlogin`) may have other roles as members. See [pg_auth_members](pg_auth_members.md).

Since this catalog contains passwords, it must not be publicly readable. [pg_roles](pg_roles.md) is a publicly readable view on `pg_authid` that blanks out the password field.

Because user identities are system-wide, `pg_authid` is shared across all databases in a WarehousePG cluster: there is only one copy of `pg_authid` per system, not one per database.

Notes<sup>1</sup>:

-   For an MD5-encrypted password, `rolpassword` column will begin with the string `md5` followed by a 32-character hexadecimal MD5 hash. The MD5 hash will be of the user's password concatenated to their user name. For example, if user `joe` has password `xyzzy` WarehousePG will store the md5 hash of `xyzzyjoe`.

-   If the password is encrypted with SCRAM-SHA-256, the `rolpassword` column has the format:

    ```
    SCRAM-SHA-256$<iteration count>:<salt>$<StoredKey>:<ServerKey>
    ```

    where `<salt>`, `<StoredKey>` and `<ServerKey>` are in Base64-encoded format. This format is the same as that specified by RFC 5803.

-   If the password is encrypted with SHA-256, the `rolpassword` column is a 64-byte hexadecimal string prefixed with the characters `sha256`.

A password that does not follow any of these formats is assumed to be unencrypted.
