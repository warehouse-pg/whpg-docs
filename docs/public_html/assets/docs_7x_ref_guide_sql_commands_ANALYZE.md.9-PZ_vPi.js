Accurate statistics helps WarehousePG choose the most appropriate query plan, and thereby improve the speed of query processing. A common strategy for read-mostly databases is to run <a href="./VACUUM.html">VACUUM</a> and <code>ANALYZE</code> once a day during a low-usage time of day. (This will not be sufficient if there is heavy update activity.) You can check for tables with missing statistics using the <code>gp_stats_missing</code> view, which is in the <code>gp_toolkit</code> schema:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>SELECT * from gp_toolkit.gp_stats_missing;</span></span></code></pre></div><p><code>ANALYZE</code> requires <code>SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE</code> lock on the target table. This lock conflicts with these locks: <code>SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE</code>, <code>SHARE</code>, <code>SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE</code>, <code>EXCLUSIVE</code>, <code>ACCESS EXCLUSIVE</code>.</p><p>If you run <code>ANALYZE</code> on a table that does not contain data, statistics are not collected for the table. For example, if you perform a <code>TRUNCATE</code> operation on a table that has statistics, and then run <code>ANALYZE</code> on the table, the statistics do not change.</p><p>For a partitioned table, specifying which portion of the table to analyze, the root partition or sub-partitions (leaf partitions) can be useful if the partitioned table has a large number of partitions that have been analyzed and only a few leaf partitions have changed.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong> When you create a partitioned table with the <code>CREATE TABLE</code> command, WarehousePG creates the table that you specify (the root partition or parent table), and also creates a hierarchy of tables based on the partition hierarchy that you specified (the child tables).</p></blockquote><ul><li><p>When you run <code>ANALYZE</code> on the root partitioned table, statistics are collected for all the leaf partitions. Leaf partitions are the lowest-level tables in the hierarchy of child tables created by WarehousePG for use by the partitioned table.</p></li><li><p>When you run <code>ANALYZE</code> on a leaf partition, statistics are collected only for that leaf partition and the root partition. If data in the leaf partition has changed (for example, you made significant updates to the leaf partition data or you exchanged the leaf partition), then you can run ANALYZE on the leaf partition to collect table statistics. By default, if all other leaf partitions have statistics, the command updates the root partition statistics.</p><p>For example, if you collected statistics on a partitioned table with a large number partitions and then updated data in only a few leaf partitions, you can run <code>ANALYZE</code> only on those partitions to update statistics on the partitions and the statistics on the root partition.</p></li><li><p>When you run <code>ANALYZE</code> on a child table that is not a leaf partition, statistics are not collected.</p><p>For example, you can create a partitioned table with partitions for the years 2006 to 2016 and sub-partitions for each month in each year. If you run <code>ANALYZE</code> on the child table for the year 2013 no statistics are collected. If you run <code>ANALYZE</code> on the leaf partition for March of 2013, statistics are collected only for that leaf partition.</p></li></ul><p>For a partitioned table that contains a leaf partition that has been exchanged to use an external table, <code>ANALYZE</code> does not collect statistics for the external table partition:</p><ul><li>If <code>ANALYZE</code> is run on an external table partition, the partition is not analyzed.</li><li>If <code>ANALYZE</code> or <code>ANALYZE ROOTPARTITION</code> is run on the root partition, external table partitions are not sampled and root table statistics do not include external table partition.</li><li>If the <code>VERBOSE</code> clause is specified, an informational message is displayed: <code>skipping external table</code>.</li></ul><p>The WarehousePG server configuration parameter <a href="./../config_params/guc-list.html">optimizer_analyze_root_partition</a> determines when statistics are collected on a root partitioned table. If the parameter is <code>on</code> (the default), the <code>ROOTPARTITION</code> keyword is not required to collect statistics on the root partition when you run <code>ANALYZE</code>. Root partition statistics are collected when you run <code>ANALYZE</code> on the root partition, or when you run <code>ANALYZE</code> on a leaf partition of the partitioned table and the other leaf partitions have statistics. If the parameter is <code>off</code>, you must run <code>ANALZYE ROOTPARTITION</code> to collect root partition statistics.</p><p>The statistics collected by <code>ANALYZE</code> usually include a list of some of the most common values in each column and a histogram showing the approximate data distribution in each column. One or both of these may be omitted if <code>ANALYZE</code> deems them uninteresting (for example, in a unique-key column, there are no common values) or if the column data type does not support the appropriate operators.</p><p>For large tables, <code>ANALYZE</code> takes a random sample of the table contents, rather than examining every row. This allows even very large tables to be analyzed in a small amount of time. Note, however, that the statistics are only approximate, and will change slightly each time <code>ANALYZE</code> is run, even if the actual table contents did not change. This may result in small changes in the planner&#39;s estimated costs shown by <code>EXPLAIN</code>. In rare situations, this non-determinism will cause the query optimizer to choose a different query plan between runs of <code>ANALYZE</code>. To avoid this, raise the amount of statistics collected by <code>ANALYZE</code> by adjusting the default_statistics_target configuration parameter, or on a column-by-column basis by setting the per-column statistics target with <code>ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET (n_distinct ...)</code> (see <code>ALTER TABLE</code>). The target value sets the maximum number of entries in the most-common-value list and the maximum number of bins in the histogram. The default target value is 100, but this can be adjusted up or down to trade off accuracy of planner estimates against the time taken for <code>ANALYZE</code> and the amount of space occupied in <code>pg_statistic</code>. In particular, setting the statistics target to zero deactivates collection of statistics for that column. It may be useful to do that for columns that are never used as part of the <code>WHERE</code>, <code>GROUP BY</code>, or <code>ORDER BY</code> clauses of queries, since the planner will have no use for statistics on such columns.</p><p>The largest statistics target among the columns being analyzed determines the number of table rows sampled to prepare the statistics. Increasing the target causes a proportional increase in the time and space needed to do <code>ANALYZE</code>.</p><p>One of the values estimated by <code>ANALYZE</code> is the number of distinct values that appear in each column. Because only a subset of the rows are examined, this estimate can sometimes be quite inaccurate, even with the largest possible statistics target. If this inaccuracy leads to bad query plans, a more accurate value can be determined manually and then installed with <code>ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET STATISTICS DISTINCT</code> (see <a href="./ALTER_TABLE.html">ALTER TABLE</a>).</p><p>When WarehousePG performs an <code>ANALYZE</code> operation to collect statistics for a table and detects that all the sampled table data pages are empty (do not contain valid data), WarehousePG displays a message that a <code>VACUUM FULL</code> operation should be performed. If the sampled pages are empty, the table statistics will be inaccurate. Pages become empty after a large number of changes to the table, for example deleting a large number of rows. A <code>VACUUM FULL</code> operation removes the empty pages and allows an <code>ANALYZE</code> operation to collect accurate statistics.</p><p>If there are no statistics for the table, the server configuration parameter <a href="./../config_params/guc-list.html">gp_enable_relsize_collection</a> controls whether the Postgres-based planner uses a default statistics file or estimates the size of a table using the <code>pg_relation_size</code> function. By default, the Postgres-based planner uses the default statistics file to estimate the number of rows if statistics are not available.</p><h2 id="examples" tabindex="-1"><a id="section6"></a>Examples <a class="header-anchor" href="#examples" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a id=&quot;section6&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Examples&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Collect statistics for the table <code>mytable</code>:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>ANALYZE mytable;</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="compatibility" tabindex="-1"><a id="section7"></a>Compatibility <a class="header-anchor" href="#compatibility" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a id=&quot;section7&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Compatibility&quot;">​</a></h2><p>There is no <code>ANALYZE</code> statement in the SQL standard.</p><h2 id="see-also" tabindex="-1"><a id="section8"></a>See Also <a class="header-anchor" href="#see-also" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a id=&quot;section8&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;See Also&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="./ALTER_TABLE.html">ALTER TABLE</a>, <a href="./EXPLAIN.html">EXPLAIN</a>, <a href="./VACUUM.html">VACUUM</a>, <a href="./../../utility_guide/ref/analyzedb.html">analyzedb</a>.</p><p><strong>Parent topic:</strong> <a href="./../sql_commands/sql_ref.html">SQL Commands</a></p>`,58)]))}const m=t(s,[["render",n]]);export{u as __pageData,m as default};
