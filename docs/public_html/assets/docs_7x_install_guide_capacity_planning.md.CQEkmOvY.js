Start with the raw capacity of the physical disks on a segment host that are available for data storage (raw_capacity), which is:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>disk_size * number_of_disks</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Account for file system formatting overhead (roughly 10 percent) and the RAID level you are using. For example, if using RAID-10, the calculation would be:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>(raw_capacity * 0.9) / 2 = formatted_disk_space</span></span></code></pre></div><p>For optimal performance, do not completely fill your disks to capacity, but run at 70% or lower. So with this in mind, calculate the usable disk space as follows:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>formatted_disk_space * 0.7 = usable_disk_space</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Using only 70% of your disk space allows WarehousePG to use the other 30% for temporary and transaction files on the same disks. If your host systems have a separate disk system that can be used for temporary and transaction files, you can specify a tablespace that WarehousePG uses for the files. Moving the location of the files might improve performance depending on the performance of the disk system.</p><p>Once you have formatted RAID disk arrays and accounted for the maximum recommended capacity (usable_disk_space), you will need to calculate how much storage is actually available for user data (<code>U</code>). If using WarehousePG mirrors for data redundancy, this would then double the size of your user data (<code>2 * U</code>). WarehousePG also requires some space be reserved as a working area for active queries. The work space should be approximately one third the size of your user data (work space = <code>U/3</code>):</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>With mirrors: (2 * U) + U/3 = usable_disk_space</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Without mirrors: U + U/3 = usable_disk_space</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Guidelines for temporary file space and user data space assume a typical analytic workload. Highly concurrent workloads or workloads with queries that require very large amounts of temporary space can benefit from reserving a larger working area. Typically, overall system throughput can be increased while decreasing work area usage through proper workload management. Additionally, temporary space and user space can be isolated from each other by specifying that they reside on different tablespaces.</p><p>In the <em>WarehousePG Administrator Guide</em>, see these topics:</p><ul><li><a href="./../admin_guide/performance.thml.html">Managing Performance</a> for information about workload management</li><li><a href="./../admin_guide/ddl/ddl-tablespace.html">Creating and Managing Tablespaces</a> for information about moving the location of temporary and transaction files</li><li><a href="./../admin_guide/managing/monitor.html">Monitoring System State</a> for information about monitoring WarehousePG disk space usage</li></ul><p><strong>Parent topic:</strong> <a href="./capacity_planning.html">Estimating Storage Capacity</a></p><h2 id="calculating-user-data-size" tabindex="-1"><a id="topic3"></a>Calculating User Data Size <a class="header-anchor" href="#calculating-user-data-size" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a id=&quot;topic3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Calculating User Data Size&quot;">​</a></h2><p>As with all databases, the size of your raw data will be slightly larger once it is loaded into the database.

The default index type in WarehousePG is B-tree. Because index size depends on the number of unique values in the index and the data to be inserted, precalculating the exact size of an index is impossible. However, you can roughly estimate the size of an index using these formulas.</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>B-tree: unique_values * (data_type_size + 24 bytes)</span></span>
