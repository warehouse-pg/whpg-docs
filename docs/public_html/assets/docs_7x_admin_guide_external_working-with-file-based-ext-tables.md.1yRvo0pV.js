External tables are often used to load and unload database data. You create a readable external table to read data from the external data source and create a writable external table to write data to the external source. You can use external tables in SQL commands just as you would a regular database table. For example, you can <code>SELECT</code> (readable external table), <code>INSERT</code> (writable external table), and <code>JOIN</code> external tables with other WarehousePG tables.</p><p>Refer to <a href="./external-tables.html">Acessing External Data with External Tables</a> for more information about using external tables to access external data.</p><h3 id="about-gpfdist-external-tables" tabindex="-1"><a id="gpfdist"></a>About gpfdist External Tables <a class="header-anchor" href="#about-gpfdist-external-tables" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a id=&quot;gpfdist&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;About gpfdist External Tables&quot;">​</a></h3><p>You can use the <code>gpfdist</code> file server utility and external tables to serve up external data to WarehousePG. When external data is served by <code>gpfdist</code>, all segments in the WarehousePG cluster can read or write external table data in parallel.
