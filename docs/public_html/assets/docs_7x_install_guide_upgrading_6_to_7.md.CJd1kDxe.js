Review the <code>gprestore</code> log file for error messages and correct any remaining problems in the source WarehousePG.</p></li><li><p>If you intend to install WarehousePG 7 on the same hardware as your 6 system, you will need enough disk space to accommodate over five times the original data set (two full copies of the primary and mirror data sets, plus the original backup data in ASCII format) in order to migrate data with <code>gpbackup</code> and <code>gprestore</code>. Keep in mind that the ASCII backup data will require more disk space than the original data, which may be stored in compressed binary format. Offline backup solutions such as Dell PowerProtect (Data Domain) can reduce the required disk space on each host.</p><p>If you do not have the disk space, then:</p><ul><li>Run <code>gpbackup</code> on your WarehousePG 6 cluster to back up your data</li><li>Run <code>gpdeletesystem</code> to remove the existing WarehousePG 6 cluster</li><li>Proceed with initializing the new cluster, as described above</li></ul></li><li><p>When restoring language-based user-defined functions, the shared object file must be in the location specified in the <code>CREATE FUNCTION</code> SQL command and must have been recompiled on the WarehousePG 7 system. This applies to user-defined functions, user-defined types, and any other objects that use custom functions, such as aggregates created with the <code>CREATE AGGREGATE</code> command.</p></li><li><p><code>gpbackup</code> saves the distribution policy and distribution key for each table in the backup so that data can be restored to the same segment. If a table&#39;s distribution key in the WarehousePG 6 database is incompatible with WarehousePG 7, <code>gprestore</code> cannot restore the table to the correct segment in the WarehousePG 6 database. This can happen if the distribution key in the older WarehousePG release has columns with data types not allowed in WarehousePG 7 distribution keys, or if the data representation for data types has changed or is insufficient for WarehousePG 7 to generate the same hash value for a distribution key. You should correct these kinds of problems by altering distribution keys in the tables before you back up the WarehousePG.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Parent topic:</strong> <a href="./install_guide/">Installing and Upgrading WarehousePG</a></p>',23)]))}const g=a(s,[["render",i]]);export{l as __pageData,g as default};
