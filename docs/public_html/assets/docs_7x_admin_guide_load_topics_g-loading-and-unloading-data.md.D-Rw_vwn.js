External tables are often used to load external data into a regular database table using a command such as <code>CREATE TABLE table AS SELECT * FROM ext_table</code>.</p></li><li><p>External web tables provide access to dynamic data. They can be backed with data from URLs accessed using the HTTP protocol or by the output of an OS script running on one or more segments.</p></li><li><p>The <code>gpfdist</code> utility is the WarehousePG parallel file distribution program. It is an HTTP server that is used with external tables to allow WarehousePG segments to load external data in parallel, from multiple file systems. You can run multiple instances of <code>gpfdist</code> on different hosts and network interfaces and access them in parallel.</p></li><li><p>The <code>gpload</code> utility automates the steps of a load task using <code>gpfdist</code> and a YAML-formatted control file.</p></li><li><p>You can create readable and writable external tables with the WarehousePG Platform Extension Framework (PXF), and use these tables to load data into, or offload data from, WarehousePG. For information about using PXF, refer to <a href="./../../external/pxf-overview.html">Accessing External Data with PXF</a>.</p></li><li><p>The WarehousePG Connector for Apache Spark provides high speed, parallel data transfer between WarehousePG and Apache Spark. For information about using the Connector, refer to the documentation at <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-WarehousePG-Connector-for-Apache-Spark/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-WarehousePG-Connector-for-Apache-Spark/index.html</a>.</p></li><li><p>The WarehousePG Connector for Apache NiFi enables you to create data ingestion pipelines that load record-oriented data into WarehousePG. For information about using this Connector, refer to the <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-WarehousePG-Connector-for-Apache-NiFi/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Connector documentation</a>.</p></li></ul><p>The method you choose to load data depends on the characteristics of the source data—its location, size, format, and any transformations required.</p><p>In the simplest case, the <code>COPY</code> SQL command loads data into a table from a text file that is accessible to the WarehousePG coordinator instance. This requires no setup and provides good performance for smaller amounts of data. With the <code>COPY</code> command, the data copied into or out of the database passes between a single file on the coordinator host and the database. This limits the total size of the dataset to the capacity of the file system where the external file resides and limits the data transfer to a single file write stream.</p><p>More efficient data loading options for large datasets take advantage of the WarehousePG MPP architecture, using the WarehousePG segments to load data in parallel. These methods allow data to load simultaneously from multiple file systems, through multiple NICs, on multiple hosts, achieving very high data transfer rates. External tables allow you to access external files from within the database as if they are regular database tables. When used with <code>gpfdist</code>, the WarehousePG parallel file distribution program, external tables provide full parallelism by using the resources of all WarehousePG segments to load or unload data.</p><p>WarehousePG leverages the parallel architecture of the Hadoop Distributed File System to access files on that system.</p>',10)]))}const f=a(r,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,f as default};
