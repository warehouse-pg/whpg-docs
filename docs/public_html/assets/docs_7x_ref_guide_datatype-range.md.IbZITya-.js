For instance, ranges of <code>timestamp</code> might be used to represent the ranges of time that a meeting room is reserved. In this case the data type is <code>tsrange</code> (short for “timestamp range”), and <code>timestamp</code> is the subtype. The subtype must have a total order so that it is well-defined whether element values are within, before, or after a range of values.</p><p>Range types are useful because they represent many element values in a single range value, and because concepts such as overlapping ranges can be expressed clearly. The use of time and date ranges for scheduling purposes is the clearest example; but price ranges, measurement ranges from an instrument, and so forth can also be useful.</p><p><strong>Parent topic:</strong> <a href="./data_types.html">Data Types</a></p><h2 id="built-in-range-types" tabindex="-1"><a id="rangetypes-builtin"></a>Built-in Range Types <a class="header-anchor" href="#built-in-range-types" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a id=&quot;rangetypes-builtin&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Built-in Range Types&quot;">​</a></h2><p>WarehousePG comes with the following built-in range types:</p><ul><li><p><code>int4range</code> -- Range of <code>integer</code></p></li><li><p><code>int8range</code> -- Range of <code>bigint</code></p></li><li><p><code>numrange</code> -- Range of <code>numeric</code></p></li><li><p><code>tsrange</code> -- Range of <code>timestamp without time zone</code></p></li><li><p><code>tstzrange</code> -- Range of <code>timestamp with time zone</code></p></li><li><p><code>daterange</code> -- Range of <code>date</code></p></li></ul><p>In addition, you can define your own range types; see <a href="./sql_commands/CREATE_TYPE.html">CREATE TYPE</a> for more information.</p><h2 id="examples" tabindex="-1"><a id="rangetypes-examples"></a>Examples <a class="header-anchor" href="#examples" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a id=&quot;rangetypes-examples&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Examples&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span></span></span>

Likewise, upper-bound may be either a string that is valid input for the subtype, or empty to indicate no upper bound.</p><p>Each bound value can be quoted using <code>&quot;</code> (double quote) characters. This is necessary if the bound value contains parentheses, brackets, commas, double quotes, or backslashes, since these characters would otherwise be taken as part of the range syntax. To put a double quote or backslash in a quoted bound value, precede it with a backslash. (Also, a pair of double quotes within a double-quoted bound value is taken to represent a double quote character, analogously to the rules for single quotes in SQL literal strings.) Alternatively, you can avoid quoting and use backslash-escaping to protect all data characters that would otherwise be taken as range syntax. Also, to write a bound value that is an empty string, write <code>&quot;&quot;</code>, since writing nothing means an infinite bound.</p><p>Whitespace is allowed before and after the range value, but any whitespace between the parentheses or brackets is taken as part of the lower or upper bound value.

Using the constructor function is frequently more convenient than writing a range literal constant, since it avoids the need for extra quoting of the bound values. The constructor function accepts two or three arguments. The two-argument form constructs a range in standard form (lower bound inclusive, upper bound exclusive), while the three-argument form constructs a range with bounds of the form specified by the third argument.

In these types two elements can be said to be adjacent, when there are no valid values between them. This contrasts with continuous ranges, where it&#39;s always (or almost always) possible to identify other element values between two given values. For example, a range over the <code>numeric</code> type is continuous, as is a range over <code>timestamp</code>. (Even though <code>timestamp</code> has limited precision, and so could theoretically be treated as discrete, it&#39;s better to consider it continuous since the step size is normally not of interest.)</p><p>Another way to think about a discrete range type is that there is a clear idea of a “next” or “previous” value for each element value. Knowing that, it is possible to convert between inclusive and exclusive representations of a range&#39;s bounds, by choosing the next or previous element value instead of the one originally given. For example, in an integer range type <code>[4,8]</code> and <code>(3,9)</code> denote the same set of values; but this would not be so for a range over numeric.</p><p>A discrete range type should have a <em>canonicalization</em> function that is aware of the desired step size for the element type. The canonicalization function is charged with converting equivalent values of the range type to have identical representations, in particular consistently inclusive or exclusive bounds. If a canonicalization function is not specified, then ranges with different formatting will always be treated as unequal, even though they might represent the same set of values in reality.</p><p>The built-in range types <code>int4range</code>, <code>int8range</code>, and <code>daterange</code> all use a canonical form that includes the lower bound and excludes the upper bound; that is, <code>[)</code>. User-defined range types can use other conventions, however.</p><h2 id="defining-new-range-types" tabindex="-1"><a id="rangetypes-defining"></a>Defining New Range Types <a class="header-anchor" href="#defining-new-range-types" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a id=&quot;rangetypes-defining&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Defining New Range Types&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Users can define their own range types. The most common reason to do this is to use ranges over subtypes not provided among the built-in range types. For example, to define a new range type of subtype <code>float8</code>:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span></span></span>

<span class="line"><span>    subtype = float8,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    subtype_diff = float8mi</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>);</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>SELECT &#39;[1.234, 5.678]&#39;::floatrange;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Because <code>float8</code> has no meaningful “step”, we do not define a canonicalization function in this example.</p><p>Defining your own range type also allows you to specify a different subtype B-tree operator class or collation to use, so as to change the sort ordering that determines which values fall into a given range.</p><p>If the subtype is considered to have discrete rather than continuous values, the CREATE TYPE command should specify a <code>canonical</code> function. The canonicalization function takes an input range value, and must return an equivalent range value that may have different bounds and formatting. The canonical output for two ranges that represent the same set of values, for example the integer ranges <code>[1, 7]</code> and <code>[1, 8)</code>, must be identical. It doesn&#39;t matter which representation you choose to be the canonical one, so long as two equivalent values with different formattings are always mapped to the same value with the same formatting. In addition to adjusting the inclusive/exclusive bounds format, a canonicalization function might round off boundary values, in case the desired step size is larger than what the subtype is capable of storing. For instance, a range type over <code>timestamp</code> could be defined to have a step size of an hour, in which case the canonicalization function would need to round off bounds that weren&#39;t a multiple of an hour, or perhaps throw an error instead.</p><p>In addition, any range type that is meant to be used with GiST or SP-GiST indexes should define a subtype difference, or <code>subtype_diff</code>, function. (The index will still work without <code>subtype_diff</code>, but it is likely to be considerably less efficient than if a difference function is provided.) The subtype difference function takes two input values of the subtype, and returns their difference (i.e., X minus Y) represented as a <code>float8</code> value. In our example above, the function <code>float8mi</code> that underlies the regular <code>float8</code> minus operator can be used; but for any other subtype, some type conversion would be necessary. Some creative thought about how to represent differences as numbers might be needed, too. To the greatest extent possible, the <code>subtype_diff</code> function should agree with the sort ordering implied by the selected operator class and collation; that is, its result should be positive whenever its first argument is greater than its second according to the sort ordering.</p><p>A less-oversimplified example of a <code>subtype_diff</code> function is:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span></span></span>
