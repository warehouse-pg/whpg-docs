This feature is also known as <em>Row-Level Security</em>. By default, tables do not have any policies, so that if a user has access privileges to a table according to the SQL privilege system, all rows within it are equally available for querying or updating.</p><p>When row security is enabled on a table (with <code>ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY</code>), all normal access to the table for selecting rows or modifying rows must be allowed by a row security policy. (However, the table&#39;s owner is typically not subject to row security policies.) If no policy exists for the table, a default-deny policy is used, meaning that no rows are visible or can be modified. Operations that apply to the whole table, such as <code>TRUNCATE</code> and <code>REFERENCES</code>, are not subject to row security.</p><p>Row security policies can be specific to commands, or to roles, or to both. A policy can be specified to apply to <code>ALL</code> commands, or to <code>SELECT</code>, <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, or <code>DELETE</code>. Multiple roles can be assigned to a given policy, and normal role membership and inheritance rules apply.</p><p>To specify which rows are visible or modifiable according to a policy, an expression is required that returns a Boolean result. This expression will be evaluated for each row prior to any conditions or functions coming from the user&#39;s query. (The only exceptions to this rule are leakproof functions, which are guaranteed to not leak information; the optimizer may choose to apply such functions ahead of the row-security check.) Rows for which the expression does not return true will not be processed. Separate expressions may be specified to provide independent control over the rows which are visible and the rows which are allowed to be modified. Policy expressions are run as part of the query and with the privileges of the user running the query, although security-definer functions can be used to access data not available to the calling user.</p><p>Superusers and roles with the <code>BYPASSRLS</code> attribute always bypass the row security system when accessing a table. Table owners normally bypass row security as well, though a table owner can choose to be subject to row security with <code>ALTER TABLE ... FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY</code>.</p><p>Enabling and disabling row security, as well as adding policies to a table, is always the privilege of the table owner only.</p><p>You create policies using the <a href="./../ref_guide/sql_commands/CREATE_POLICY.html">CREATE POLICY</a> command, alter policies using the <a href="./../ref_guide/sql_commands/ALTER_POLICY.html">ALTER POLICY</a> command, and drop policies using the <a href="./../ref_guide/sql_commands/DROP_POLICY.html">DROP POLICY</a> command. To enable and disable row security for a given table, use the <a href="./../ref_guide/sql_commands/ALTER_TABLE.html">ALTER TABLE</a> command.</p><p>Each policy has a name, and you can define multiple policies for a table. As policies are table-specific, each policy for a table must have a unique name. Different tables may have policies with the same name.</p><p>When multiple policies apply to a given query, they are combined using either <code>OR</code> (for permissive policies, which are the default) or using <code>AND</code> (for restrictive policies). This is similar to the rule that a given role has the privileges of all roles of which they are a member. Permissive vs. restrictive policies are discussed further below.</p><p>Here is a simple example that creates a policy on the <code>account</code> relation to allow only members of the <code>managers</code> role to access rows, and only rows of their accounts:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>CREATE TABLE accounts (manager text, company text, contact_email text);</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>ALTER TABLE accounts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>CREATE POLICY account_managers ON accounts TO managers</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    USING (manager = current_user);</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The policy above implicitly provides a <code>WITH CHECK</code> clause identical to its <code>USING</code> clause, so that the constraint applies both to rows selected by a command (so a manager cannot <code>SELECT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, or <code>DELETE</code> existing rows belonging to a different manager) and to rows modified by a command (so rows belonging to a different manager cannot be created via <code>INSERT</code> or <code>UPDATE</code>).</p><p>If no role is specified, or the special user name <code>PUBLIC</code> is used, then the policy applies to all users on the system. To allow all users to access only their own row in a <code>users</code> table, you can create a simple policy as follows:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>CREATE POLICY user_policy ON users</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    USING (user_name = current_user);</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This works similarly to the previous example.</p><p>To use a different policy for rows that are being added to the table compared to those rows that are visible, you can combine multiple policies. This pair of policies would allow all users to view all rows in the <code>users</code> table, but modify only their own:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>CREATE POLICY user_sel_policy ON users</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>CREATE POLICY user_mod_policy ON users</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    USING (user_name = current_user);</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In a <code>SELECT</code> command, these two policies are combined using <code>OR</code>, with the net effect being that all rows can be selected. In other command types, only the second policy applies, so that the effects are the same as before.</p><p>Row security can also be disabled with the <code>ALTER TABLE</code> command. Disabling row security does not remove any policies that are defined on the table; they are simply ignored. Then all rows in the table are visible and modifiable, subject to the standard SQL privileges system.</p><p>The example below is more comprehensive.

Take care when developing schemas and row-level policies to avoid &quot;covert channel&quot; leaks of information through such referential integrity checks.</p><p>In some contexts, it is important to be sure that row security is not being applied. For example, when taking a backup, it could be disastrous if row security silently caused some rows to be omitted from the backup. In such a situation, you can set the <a href="./../ref_guide/config_params/guc-list.html#row_security">row_security</a> configuration parameter to <code>off</code>. This does not in itself bypass row security; what it does is throw an error if any query&#39;s results would get filtered by a policy. You can then investigate the reason for the error and fix it.</p><p>In the examples above, the policy expressions consider only the current values in the row to be accessed or updated. This is the simplest and best-performing case; when possible, it is best to design row security applications to work this way. If it is necessary to consult other rows or other tables to make a policy decision, that can be accomplished using sub-<code>SELECT</code>s, or functions that contain <code>SELECT</code>s, in the policy expressions. Be aware, however, that such accesses can create race conditions that could allow information leakage if care is not taken.

That happens if her transaction reaches the information row just after <code>alice</code>&#39;s does. It blocks waiting for <code>alice</code>&#39;s transaction to commit, then fetches the updated row contents thanks to the <code>FOR UPDATE</code> clause. However, it does not fetch an updated row for the implicit <code>SELECT</code> from <code>users</code>, because that sub-<code>SELECT</code> did not have <code>FOR UPDATE</code>; instead the <code>users</code> row is read with the snapshot taken at the start of the query. Therefore, the policy expression tests the old value of <code>mallory</code>&#39;s privilege level and allows her to see the updated row.</p><p>There are several ways around this problem. One simple answer is to use <code>SELECT ... FOR SHARE</code> in sub-<code>SELECT</code>s in row security policies. However, that requires granting <code>UPDATE</code> privilege on the referenced table (here <code>users</code>) to the affected users, which might be undesirable. (But another row security policy could be applied to prevent them from actually exercising that privilege; or the sub-<code>SELECT</code> could be embedded into a security definer function.) Also, heavy concurrent use of row share locks on the referenced table could pose a performance problem, especially if updates of it are frequent. Another solution, practical if updates of the referenced table are infrequent, is to take an <code>ACCESS EXCLUSIVE</code> lock on the referenced table when updating it, so that no concurrent transactions could be examining old row values. Or one could just wait for all concurrent transactions to end after committing an update of the referenced table and before making changes that rely on the new security situation.</p><p>For additional details see <a href="./../ref_guide/sql_commands/CREATE_POLICY.html">CREATE POLICY</a> and <a href="./../ref_guide/sql_commands/ALTER_TABLE.html">ALTER TABLE</a>.</p><h2 id="about-row-level-security-for-views" tabindex="-1"><a id="views"></a>About Row-Level Security for Views <a class="header-anchor" href="#about-row-level-security-for-views" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a id=&quot;views&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;About Row-Level Security for Views&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>You can simulate row-level access by using views to restrict the rows that are selected. You can simulate row-level labels by adding an extra column to the table to store sensitivity information, and then using views to control row-level access based on this column. You can then grant roles access to the views rather than to the base table.</p><p>While views can hide the contents of certain columns, they cannot be used to reliably conceal the data in unseen rows. When it is necessary for a view to provide row-level security, you must apply the <code>security_barrier</code> attribute to the view. This prevents maliciously-chosen functions and operators from being passed values from rows until after the view has done its work. For example, this view is secure:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>CREATE VIEW phone_number WITH (security_barrier) AS</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    SELECT person, phone FROM phone_data WHERE phone NOT LIKE &#39;412%&#39;;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Views created with the <code>security_barrier</code> attribute may perform far worse than views created without this option. In general, there is no way to avoid this: the fastest possible plan must be rejected if it may compromise security. For this reason, the <code>security_barrier</code> option is not enabled by default.</p><p>Be sure to review <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/rules-privileges.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Rules and Privileges</a> in the PostgreSQL documentation for detailed information about securing views.</p>`,46)]))}const m=e(i,[["render",o]]);export{u as __pageData,m as default};
