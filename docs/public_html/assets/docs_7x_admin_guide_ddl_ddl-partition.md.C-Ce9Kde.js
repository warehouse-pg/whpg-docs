Partitioning tables can improve query performance when it allows the WarehousePG query optimizer to scan only the data needed to satisfy a given query instead of scanning the complete contents of a large table.</p><p>Partitioning does not change the physical distribution of table data across the segments. Table distribution is physical: WarehousePG physically divides partitioned tables and non-partitioned tables across segments to enable parallel query processing. Table <em>partitioning</em> is logical: WarehousePG logically divides big tables to improve query performance and facilitate data warehouse maintenance tasks, such as rolling old data out of the data warehouse.</p><p><strong>Parent topic:</strong> <a href="./../ddl/ddl.html">DDL: Defining Database Objects</a></p><h2 id="why-table-partitioning" tabindex="-1"><a id="topic_tvx_nsz_bt"></a>Why Table Partitioning? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-table-partitioning" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a id=&quot;topic_tvx_nsz_bt&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Why Table Partitioning?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Partitioning can provide several benefits:</p><ul><li>Dramatically improves query performance in certain situations, particularly when most of the heavily accessed rows of the table are in a single partition or a small number of partitions. Partitioning effectively substitutes for the upper tree levels of indexes, making it more likely that the heavily-used parts of the indexes fit in memory.</li><li>When queries or updates access a large percentage of a single partition, you can improve performance by using a sequential scan of that partition instead of using an index, which would require random-access reads scattered across the whole table.</li><li>When the partitioning design accounts for the usage pattern, you can perform bulk loads and deletes by adding or removing partitions. Dropping an individual partition using <code>DROP TABLE</code>, or doing <code>ALTER TABLE DETACH PARTITION</code>, is far faster than a bulk operation. These commands also entirely prevent the <code>VACUUM</code> overhead caused by a bulk <code>DELETE</code>.</li><li>You can migrate seldom-used data to cheaper and slower storage media.</li></ul><p>These benefits will normally be worthwhile only when a table would otherwise be very large. The exact point at which a table will benefit from partitioning depends on the application, although a rule of thumb is that the size of the table should exceed the physical memory of the database server.</p><h2 id="about-the-table-partitioning-methods" tabindex="-1"><a id="part_method"></a>About the Table Partitioning Methods <a class="header-anchor" href="#about-the-table-partitioning-methods" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a id=&quot;part_method&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;About the Table Partitioning Methods&quot;">​</a></h2><p>WarehousePG supports the following forms of table partitioning:</p><p><em>Range Partitioning</em> : The table is partitioned into &quot;ranges&quot; defined by a key column or set of columns, with no overlap between the ranges of values assigned to different partitions. For example, one might partition by date ranges, or by ranges of identifiers for particular business objects. Each range&#39;s bounds are understood as being inclusive at the lower end and exclusive at the upper end. For example, if one partition&#39;s range is from <code>1</code> to <code>10</code>, and the next one&#39;s range is from <code>10</code> to <code>20</code>, the value <code>10</code> belongs to the second partition not the first.</p><p><em>List Partitioning</em> : The table is partitioned by explicitly listing which key value(s) appear in each partition, for example sales territory or product line.</p><p><em>Hash Partitioning</em> : The table is partitioned by specifying a modulus and a remainder for each partition. Each partition holds the rows for which the hash value of the partition key divided by the specified modulus produces the specified remainder.</p><p>The following figure illustrates a multi-level partition design utilizing both date-range and list partitioning.</p><p><a id="#im207241"></a></p><p><img src="'+o+`" alt="Example Multi-level Partition Design" title="Example Multi-level Partition Design"></p><h2 id="about-table-partitioning-in-warehousepg" tabindex="-1"><a id="topic64"></a>About Table Partitioning in WarehousePG <a class="header-anchor" href="#about-table-partitioning-in-warehousepg" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a id=&quot;topic64&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;About Table Partitioning in WarehousePG&quot;">​</a></h2><p>WarehousePG allows you to declare that a table is divided into partitions. The table that is divided is a <em>partitioned table</em>. The declaration includes the <em>partitioning method</em> as described above, plus a list of columns or expressions to be used as the <em>partition key</em>.</p><p>The partitioned table itself is a &quot;virtual&quot; table having no storage of its own. Instead, the storage belongs to partitions, which are otherwise ordinary tables associated with the partitioned table. Each partition stores a subset of the data as defined by its <em>partition bounds</em>. WarehousePG routes all rows inserted into a partitioned table to the appropriate partitions based on the values of the partition key column(s). WarehousePG will move a row to a different partition if you update the partition key and the key no longer satisfies the partition bounds of its original partition.</p><p>You initially partition tables during creation by specifying the <code>PARTITION BY</code> or <code>PARTITION OF</code> clause to the <a href="./../../ref_guide/sql_commands/CREATE_TABLE.html">CREATE TABLE</a> command. When you created a partitioned table, you create a top-level <em>root partitioned table</em> with one or more levels of <em>child</em> tables. The table at the level immediately above a child table is the <em>parent</em>. A table at the highest level in a partition hierarchy is a <em>leaf partition</em>. A leaf partition has no child tables, and leaf partitions in the same partition hierarchy may reside at different depths.</p><p>WarehousePG uses the partition criteria (boundaries) defined during table creation to create each partition with a distinct partition constraint, which limits the data that table can contain. The query optimizers use partition constraints to determine which table partitions to scan to satisfy a given query predicate.</p><p>A partition itself may be defined as a partitioned table, resulting in sub-partitioning. Although all partitions must have the same columns as their partitioned parent, partitions may have their own indexes, constraints, and default values, distinct from those of other partitions. Refer to the <a href="./../../ref_guide/sql_commands/CREATE_TABLE.html">CREATE TABLE</a> command reference for more details on creating partitioned tables and partitions.</p><p>Each partition&#39;s definition must specify bounds that correspond to the partitioning method and partition key of the parent. WarehousePG returns an error if the bounds of a new partition&#39;s values overlap with those in one or more existing partitions. Partitions are in every way normal WarehousePG tables (or, possibly, external or foreign tables). You can specify a tablespace and storage parameters for each partition separately.</p><p>Because partitions themselves are independent tables, if a table that is part of a partition hierarchy itself is writable, you can write to it through its parent also, as long as granted the correct permission.</p><p>You cannot turn a regular table into a partitioned table or vice-versa. However, it is possible to add an existing regular or partitioned table as a partition of a partitioned table, or to remove a partition from a partitioned table turning it into a standalone table; these operations can simplify and speed up many maintenance processes. Refer to the <a href="./../../ref_guide/sql_commands/ALTER_TABLE.html">ALTER TABLE</a> command reference to learn more about the syntax for these operations.</p><p>While a partition can also be an external table or foreign table, take extra care because it becomes your responsibility to ensure that the contents of the table satisfy the partitioning rule. There are other restrictions for foreign tables as well; refer to the <a href="./../../ref_guide/sql_commands/CREATE_FOREIGN_TABLE.html">CREATE FOREIGN TABLE</a> command reference for more information.</p><h2 id="deciding-on-a-table-partitioning-strategy" tabindex="-1"><a id="topic65"></a>Deciding on a Table Partitioning Strategy <a class="header-anchor" href="#deciding-on-a-table-partitioning-strategy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a id=&quot;topic65&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Deciding on a Table Partitioning Strategy&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Not all hash-distributed or randomly distributed tables are good candidates for partitioning. If the answer is <strong>yes</strong> to all or most of the following questions, table partitioning is a viable database design strategy for improving query performance. If the answer is <strong>no</strong> to most of the following questions, table partitioning is not the right solution for that table. Always test your design strategy to ensure that query performance improves as expected.</p><ul><li><strong>Is the table large enough?</strong> Large fact tables are good candidates for table partitioning. If you have millions or billions of records in a table, you may see performance benefits from logically breaking that data up into smaller chunks. For smaller tables with only a few thousand rows or less, the administrative overhead of maintaining the partitions may outweigh any performance benefits that you might see.</li><li><strong>Are you experiencing unsatisfactory performance?</strong> As with any performance tuning initiative, a table should be partitioned only if queries against that table are producing slower response times than desired.</li><li><strong>Do your query predicates have identifiable access patterns?</strong> Examine the <code>WHERE</code> clauses of your query workload and look for table columns that are consistently used to access data. For example, if most of your queries tend to look up records by date, then a monthly or weekly date-partitioning design might be beneficial. Or if you tend to access records by region, consider a list-partitioning design to divide the table by region.</li><li><strong>Does your data warehouse maintain a window of historical data?</strong> Another consideration for partition design is your organization&#39;s business requirements for maintaining historical data. For example, your data warehouse may require that you keep data for the past twelve months. If the data is partitioned by month, you can easily drop the oldest monthly partition from the warehouse and load current data into the most recent monthly partition.</li><li><strong>Can the data be divided into somewhat equal parts based on some defining criteria?</strong> Choose partitioning criteria that will divide your data as evenly as possible. If the partitions contain a relatively equal number of records, query performance improves based on the number of partitions created. For example, by dividing a large table into 10 partitions, a query will run 10 times faster than it would against the unpartitioned table, provided that the partitions are designed to support the query&#39;s criteria.</li></ul><p>Do not create more partitions than are needed. Creating too many partitions can slow down management and maintenance jobs, such as vacuuming, recovering segments, expanding the cluster, checking disk usage, and others.</p><p>Partitioning does not improve query performance unless the query optimizer can eliminate partitions based on the query predicates. Queries that scan every partition run slower than if the table were not partitioned, so avoid partitioning if few of your queries achieve partition elimination. Check the explain plan for queries to make sure that partitions are eliminated. See <a href="./../query/topics/query-profiling.html">Query Profiling</a> for more about partition elimination.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Caution</strong> Be very careful with multi-level partitioning, as the number of partition files can grow very quickly. For example, if a table is partitioned by both day and city, and there are 1,000 days of data and 1,000 cities, the total number of partitions is one million. Column-oriented tables store each column in a physical table, so if this table has 100 columns, the system would be required to manage 100 million files for the table, for each segment.</p></blockquote><p>Before settling on a multi-level partitioning strategy, consider a single level partition with bitmap indexes. Indexes slow down data loads, so performance testing with your data and schema is recommended to decide on the best strategy.</p><h2 id="choosing-the-partitioning-syntax" tabindex="-1"><a id="choose"></a>Choosing the Partitioning Syntax <a class="header-anchor" href="#choosing-the-partitioning-syntax" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a id=&quot;choose&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Choosing the Partitioning Syntax&quot;">​</a></h2><p>WarehousePG 7 retains most aspects of the partitioning syntax of prior versions of WarehousePG, referred to as the <em>classic</em> syntax. Version 7 also introduces support for a <em>modern</em> syntax, derived from the PostgreSQL declarative partitioning syntax.</p><p>The classic syntax is provided for backwards compatibility with previous WarehousePG versions. It is appropriate for a homogenous partitioned table, where all partitions are at the same leaf level and have the same partition rule.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong> The modern syntax is less specialized and easier to use, and is recommended for new users and new partitioned table definitions.</p></blockquote><p>The classic and modern partitioning syntaxes are alternatives, you choose the one that meets your needs.</p><p>If you are familiar with the WarehousePG 6 partitioning syntax or already have partitioned tables that were defined using this syntax, you may choose to continue using the classic syntax. (Refer to <a href="./about-part-changes.html">About Changes to Table Partitioning in WarehousePG 7</a> for more information about partitioning syntax and behavior changes introduced in version 7.)</p><p>The following table provides a feature comparison to help you choose the syntax most appropriate for your data model:</p><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Classic Syntax</th><th>Modern Syntax</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Heterogeneous partition hierarchy</td><td>Not supported.

Before you create the table, you should:</p><ol><li>Choose the partition method: date range, numeric range, list of values, hash.</li><li>Choose the column(s) on which to partition the table.</li><li>Determine the appropriate number of partitions and partition levels. For example, you may choose to create a table that is date-range partitioned by month, and then sub-partition the monthly partitions by sales region.</li><li>Create the partitioned table.</li><li>Create the partitions.</li></ol><p>You are not required to manually create table constraints describing the partition boundary conditions for partitions, WarehousePG creates such constraints automatically.</p><p>After you create a partition, WarehousePG directs to the partition any data inserted into the root partitioned table that matches this partition&#39;s partition constraints. The partition key specified may overlap with the parent&#39;s partition key, although take care when specifying the bounds of a sub-partition such that the set of data it accepts constitutes a subset of what the partition&#39;s own bounds allow; WarehousePG does not check whether that&#39;s really the case.</p><p>You can use the same partition key column to create sub-partitions if necessary, for example, to partition by month and then sub-partition by day. Consider partitioning by the most granular level. For example, for a table partitioned by date, you can partition by day and have 365 daily partitions, rather than partition by year then sub-partition by month then sub-partition by day. A multi-level design can reduce query planning time, but a flat partition design typically runs faster.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Important</strong> The examples in the next section use the modern partitioning syntax.

An index will be helpful in the latter case but not the former.</p><p>Partition pruning can be performed not only during the planning of a given query, but also during its execution. This is useful because it can allow more partitions to be pruned when clauses contain expressions whose values are not known at query planning time, for example, parameters defined in a <code>PREPARE</code> statement, using a value obtained from a subquery, or using a parameterized value on the inner side of a nested loop join. Partition pruning during execution can be performed at any of the following times:</p><ul><li><p>During initialization of the query plan. Partition pruning can be performed here for parameter values which are known during the initialization phase of execution. Partitions which are pruned during this stage will not show up in the query&#39;s <code>EXPLAIN</code> or <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code>. It is possible to determine the number of partitions which were removed during this phase by observing the &quot;Subplans Removed&quot; property in the <code>EXPLAIN</code> output.</p></li><li><p>During actual execution of the query plan. Partition pruning may also be performed here to remove partitions using values which are only known when running the actual query. This includes values from subqueries and values from run-time parameters such as those from parameterized nested loop joins. Since the value of these parameters may change many times during the execution of the query, WarehousePG performs partition pruning whenever one of the run-time parameters being used by partition pruning changes. Determining whether partitions were pruned during this phase requires careful inspection of the loops property in the <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code> output. Subplans corresponding to different partitions may have different values for it depending on how many times each of them was pruned during execution. Some may be shown as <code>(never executed)</code> if they were pruned every time.</p></li></ul><h2 id="partition-maintenance" tabindex="-1"><a id="topic77"></a>Partition Maintenance <a class="header-anchor" href="#partition-maintenance" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a id=&quot;topic77&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Partition Maintenance&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Normally, the set of partitions established when initially defining the table is not intended to remain static. Common scenarios include removing partitions holding old data and periodically adding new partitions for new data. One of the biggest advantages of partitioning is precisely that it allows you to perform these tasks nearly instantaneously by manipulating the partition structure, rather than physically moving around large amounts of data.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Important</strong> The examples in the next section use the modern partitioning syntax.

You can add a partition to a partition hierarchy both at the time of, or after, table creation.</p><p>To add to the partition hierarchy during table creation, use the <code>CREATE TABLE ...

Be sure to drop the now-redundant <code>CHECK</code> constraint after the <code>ATTACH PARTITION</code> completes.

If you do not do this, WarehousePG scans the <code>DEFAULT</code> partition to verify that it contains no records which should be located in the partition being attached. WarehousePG performs this operation whiling holding an <code>ACCESS EXCLUSIVE</code> lock on the <code>DEFAULT</code> partition. If the <code>DEFAULT</code> partition is itself a partitioned table, then WarehousePG recursively checks each of its partitions in the same way as the table being attached, as mentioned above.</p><h3 id="indexing-partitioned-tables" tabindex="-1"><a id="indexing"></a>Indexing Partitioned Tables <a class="header-anchor" href="#indexing-partitioned-tables" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a id=&quot;indexing&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Indexing Partitioned Tables&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Creating an index on the key column(s) of a partitioned table automatically creates a matching index on each partition, and any partitions that you create or attach later will also have such an index. An index or unique constraint declared on a partitioned table is &quot;virtual&quot; in the same way that the partitioned table is: the actual data is in child indexes on the individual partition tables.</p><p>Creating indexes on partitioned tables so that they are applied automatically to the entire hierarchy is very convenient; not only will the existing partitions be indexed, but any partitions that are created in the future will be indexed as well. To avoid long lock times, you can <code>CREATE INDEX ON ONLY</code> the partitioned table. Such an index is marked invalid, and WarehousePG does not apply the index automatically to the partitions. You can create the indexes on partitions individually, and then attach to the index on the parent using <code>ALTER INDEX .. ATTACH PARTITION</code>. After indexes for all partitions are attached to the parent index, the parent index is marked valid automatically. For example:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>CREATE INDEX measurement_usls_idx ON ONLY measurement (unitsales);</span></span>

Detaching a partition that has sub-partitions automatically detaches those partitions as well.</p><p>For range partitions, it is common to detach the older partitions to roll old data out of the data warehouse.

The best choice is often to partition by the column or set of columns which most commonly appear in <code>WHERE</code> clauses of queries being run on the partitioned table. WarehousePG can use <code>WHERE</code> clauses that are compatible with the partition bound constraints to prune unneeded partitions. However, you may be forced into making other decisions by requirements for the <code>PRIMARY KEY</code> or a <code>UNIQUE</code> constraint. Removal of unwanted data is also a factor to consider when you plann your partitioning strategy. An entire partition can be detached fairly quickly, so it may be beneficial to design the partition strategy in such a way that all data that you wnat to remove at once is located in a single partition.</p><p>Choosing the target number of partitions that the table should be divided into is also a critical decision. Not having enough partitions may mean that indexes remain too large and that data locality remains poor, which could result in low cache hit ratios. However, dividing the table into too many partitions can also cause issues. Too many partitions can result in longer query planning times and higher memory consumption during both query planning and execution, as further described below. When choosing how to partition your table, it&#39;s also important to consider what changes may occur in the future. For example, if you choose to have one partition per customer and you currently have a small number of large customers, consider the implications if in several years you instead find yourself with a large number of small customers. In this case, it may be better to choose to partition by <code>HASH</code> and choose a reasonable number of partitions rather than trying to partition by <code>LIST</code> and hoping that the number of customers does not increase beyond what it is practical to partition the data by.</p><p>Sub-partitioning can be useful to further divide partitions that are expected to become larger than other partitions. Another option is to use range partitioning with multiple columns in the partition key. Either of these can easily lead to excessive numbers of partitions, so restraint is advisable.</p><p>It is important to consider the overhead of partitioning during query planning and execution. The query planner and optimizer are generally able to handle partition hierarchies with up to a few thousand partitions fairly well, provided that typical queries allow the query planner to prune all but a small number of partitions. Planning times become longer and memory consumption becomes higher when more partitions remain after the planner performs partition pruning. This is particularly true for the <code>UPDATE</code> and <code>DELETE</code> commands. Another reason for concern about a large number of partitions is that the server&#39;s memory consumption may grow significantly over time, especially if many sessions touch large numbers of partitions. That&#39;s because each partition requires its metadata to be loaded into the local memory of each session that touches it.</p><p>If your workloads are performing data warehousing tasks, it can make sense to use a larger number of partitions than with an OLTP type workload. Generally, in data warehouses, query planning time is less of a concern as the majority of processing time is spent during query execution. With either of these two types of workload, it is important to make the right decisions early, as re-partitioning large quantities of data can be painfully slow. Simulations of the intended workload are often beneficial for optimizing the partitioning strategy. Never just assume that more partitions are better than fewer partitions, nor vice-versa.</p><h2 id="limitations" tabindex="-1"><a id="topic72"></a>Limitations <a class="header-anchor" href="#limitations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a id=&quot;topic72&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Limitations&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Take note of the following WarehousePG partitioned table limitations:</p><ul><li>A partitioned table can have a maximum of 32,767 partitions at each level.</li><li>WarehousePG does not support partitioning replicated tables (tables created with the <code>DISTRIBUTED REPLICATED</code> distribution policy).</li><li>The WarehousePG query optimizer (GPORCA) does not support uniform multi-level partitioned tables. If GPORCA is enabled (the default) and the partitioned table is multi-level, WarehousePG runs queries against the table with the Postgres-based planner.</li><li>The WarehousePG <code>gpbackup</code> utility does not back up data from a leaf partition of a partitioned table when the leaf partition is an external or foreign table.</li><li>To create a unique or primary key constraint on a partitioned table, the partition keys must not include any expressions or function calls and the constraint&#39;s columns must include all of the partition key columns. This limitation exists because the individual indexes making up the constraint can only directly enforce uniqueness within their own partitions; the partition structure itself must guarantee that there are not duplicates in different partitions.</li><li>There is no way to create an exclusion constraint spanning the whole partitioned table. You can put such a constraint only on each leaf partition individually. This limitation stems from not being able to enforce cross-partition restrictions.</li><li>Mixing temporary and permanent relations in the same partition hierarchy is not allowed. If the partitioned table is permanent, so must be its partitions and likewise if the partitioned table is temporary. When using temporary relations, all members of the partition hierarchy must be from the same session.</li></ul><p>Individual partitions are linked to their partitioned table using inheritance behind the scenes. However, it is not possible to use all of the generic features of inheritance with declaratively partitioned tables or their partitions, as discussed below. Notably, a partition cannot have any parents other than the partitioned table it is a partition of, nor can a table inherit from both a partitioned table and a regular table. Partitioned tables and their partitions never share an inheritance hierarchy with regular tables.</p><p>Since a partition hierarchy consisting of the partitioned table and its partitions is still an inheritance hierarchy, <code>tableoid</code> and all of the normal rules of inheritance apply as described in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/ddl-inherit.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Inheritance</a> in the PostgreSQL documentation, with a few exceptions:</p><ul><li>Partitions cannot have columns that are not present in the parent. It is not possible to specify columns when creating partitions with <code>CREATE TABLE</code>, nor is it possible to add columns to partitions after-the-fact using <code>ALTER TABLE</code>. Tables may be added as a partition with <code>ALTER TABLE ... ATTACH PARTITION</code> only if their columns exactly match the parent.</li><li>Both <code>CHECK</code> and <code>NOT NULL</code> constraints of a partitioned table are always inherited by all of its partitions. WarehousePG does not permit <code>CHECK</code> constraints that are marked <code>NO INHERIT</code> to be created on partitioned tables. You cannot drop a <code>NOT NULL</code> constraint on a partition&#39;s column if the same constraint is present in the parent table.</li><li>Using <code>ONLY</code> to add or drop a constraint on only the partitioned table is supported as long as there are no partitions. Once partitions exist, using <code>ONLY</code> will result in an error. Instead, constraints on the partitions themselves can be added and (if they are not present in the parent table) dropped.</li><li>As a partitioned table does not have any data itself, attempts to use <code>TRUNCATE ONLY</code> on a partitioned table always return an error.</li></ul><p>When a leaf partition is an external or foreign table, the following limitations hold:</p><ul><li><p>If the external or foreign table partition is not writable or the user does not have permission to write to the table, commands that attempt to modify data in the external or foreign partition (<code>INSERT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, or <code>TRUNCATE</code>) return an error.</p></li><li><p>A <code>COPY</code> command cannot copy data to a partitioned table that updates an external or foreign table partition.</p></li><li><p>A <code>COPY</code> command that attempts to copy from an external or foreign table partition returns an error unless you specify the <code>IGNORE EXTERNAL PARTITIONS</code> clause. When you specify the clause, WarehousePG does not copy data from external or foreign table partitions.</p><p>To use the <code>COPY</code> command against a partitioned table with a leaf partition that is an external or foreign table, use an SQL expression rather than the partitioned table name to copy the data. For example, if the table <code>my_sales</code> contains a leaf partition that is an external table, this command sends the data to <code>stdout</code>:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>COPY (SELECT * from my_sales ) TO stdout</span></span></code></pre></div></li><li><p><code>VACUUM</code> commands skip external and foreign table partitions.</p></li><li><p>If the external or foreign table partition is not writable or the user does not have permission to write to the table, WarehousePG returns an error on the following operations:</p><ul><li>Adding or dropping a column.</li><li>Changing the data type of a column.</li></ul></li></ul><p>These (<em>classic syntax</em>) <code>ALTER TABLE ...
