Loss of power can lead to temporarily unavailable components. A system can be made highly available by providing redundant standbys for components that can fail so that services can continue uninterrupted when a failure does occur. In some cases, the cost of redundancy is higher than users&#39; tolerance for interruption in service. When this is the case, the goal is to ensure that full service is able to be restored, and can be restored within an expected timeframe.</p><p>With WarehousePG, fault tolerance and data availability is achieved with:</p><ul><li><a href="#raid">Hardware level RAID storage protection</a></li><li><a href="#checksums">Data storage checksums</a></li><li><a href="#segment_mirroring">WarehousePG segment mirroring</a></li><li><a href="#coordinator_mirroring">Coordinator mirroring</a></li><li><a href="#dual_clusters">Dual clusters</a></li><li><a href="#backup_restore">Database backup and restore</a></li></ul><h2 id="hardware-level-raid" tabindex="-1"><a id="raid"></a>Hardware level RAID <a class="header-anchor" href="#hardware-level-raid" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a id=&quot;raid&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hardware level RAID&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A best practice WarehousePG deployment uses hardware level RAID to provide high performance redundancy for single disk failure without having to go into the database level fault tolerance. This provides a lower level of redundancy at the disk level.</p><h2 id="data-storage-checksums" tabindex="-1"><a id="checksums"></a>Data storage checksums <a class="header-anchor" href="#data-storage-checksums" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a id=&quot;checksums&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Data storage checksums&quot;">​</a></h2><p>WarehousePG uses checksums to verify that data loaded from disk to memory has not been corrupted on the file system.</p><p>WarehousePG has two kinds of storage for user data: heap and append-optimized. Both storage models use checksums to verify data read from the file system and, with the default settings, they handle checksum verification errors in a similar way.</p><p>WarehousePG coordinator and segment database processes update data on pages in the memory they manage. When a memory page is updated and flushed to disk, checksums are computed and saved with the page. When a page is later retrieved from disk, the checksums are verified and the page is only permitted to enter managed memory if the verification succeeds. A failed checksum verification is an indication of corruption in the file system and causes WarehousePG to generate an error, cancelling the transaction.</p><p>The default checksum settings provide the best level of protection from undetected disk corruption propagating into the database and to mirror segments.</p><p>Heap checksum support is enabled by default when the WarehousePG cluster is initialized with the <code>gpinitsystem</code> management utility. Although it is strongly discouraged, a cluster can be initialized without heap checksum support by setting the <code>HEAP_CHECKSUM</code> parameter to off in the <code>gpinitsystem</code> cluster configuration file. See <a href="./../../utility_guide/ref/gpinitsystem.html">gpinitsystem</a>.</p><p>Once initialized, it is not possible to change heap checksum support for a cluster without reinitializing the system and reloading databases.</p><p>You can check the read-only server configuration parameter <a href="./../../ref_guide/config_params/guc-list.html">data_checksums</a> to see if heap checksums are enabled in a cluster:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>$ gpconfig -s data_checksums</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When a WarehousePG cluster starts up, the <code>gpstart</code> utility checks that heap checksums are consistently enabled or deactivated on the coordinator and all segments. If there are any differences, the cluster fails to start. See <a href="./../../utility_guide/ref/gpstart.html">gpstart</a>.</p><p>In cases where it is necessary to ignore heap checksum verification errors so that data can be recovered, setting the <a href="./../../ref_guide/config_params/guc-list.html">ignore_checksum_failure</a> system configuration parameter to on causes WarehousePG to issue a warning when a heap checksum verification fails, but the page is then permitted to load into managed memory. If the page is updated and saved to disk, the corrupted data could be replicated to the mirror segment. Because this can lead to data loss, setting <code>ignore_checksum_failure</code> to on should only be done to enable data recovery.</p><p>For append-optimized storage, checksum support is one of several storage options set at the time an append-optimized table is created with the <code>CREATE TABLE</code> command. The default storage options are specified in the <code>gp_default_storage_options</code> server configuration parameter. The <code>checksum</code> storage option is activated by default and deactivating it is strongly discouraged.</p><p>If you choose to deactivate checksums for an append-optimized table, you can either</p><ul><li>change the <code>gp_default_storage_options</code> configuration parameter to include <code>checksum=false</code> before creating the table, or</li><li>add the <code>checksum=false</code> option to the <code>WITH storage\\_options</code> clause of the <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statement.</li></ul><p>Note that the <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statement allows you to set storage options, including checksums, for individual partition files.</p><p>See the <a href="./../../ref_guide/sql_commands/CREATE_TABLE.html">CREATE TABLE</a> command reference and the <a href="./../../ref_guide/config_params/guc-list.html">gp_default_storage_options</a> configuration parameter reference for syntax and examples.</p><h2 id="segment-mirroring" tabindex="-1"><a id="segment_mirroring"></a>Segment Mirroring <a class="header-anchor" href="#segment-mirroring" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a id=&quot;segment_mirroring&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Segment Mirroring&quot;">​</a></h2><p>WarehousePG stores data in multiple segment instances, each of which is a WarehousePG PostgreSQL instance. The data for each table is spread between the segments based on the distribution policy that is defined for the table in the DDL at the time the table is created. When segment mirroring is enabled, for each segment instance there is a <em>primary</em> and <em>mirror</em> pair. The mirror segment is kept up to date with the primary segment using Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)-based streaming replication. See <a href="./overview-of-segment-mirroring.html">Overview of Segment Mirroring</a>.</p><p>The mirror instance for each segment is usually initialized with the <code>gpinitsystem</code> utility or the <code>gpexpand</code> utility. As a best practice, the mirror runs on a different host than the primary instance to protect from a single machine failure. There are different strategies for assigning mirrors to hosts. When choosing the layout of the primaries and mirrors, it is important to consider the failure scenarios to ensure that processing skew is minimized in the case of a single machine failure.</p><h2 id="coordinator-mirroring" tabindex="-1"><a id="coordinator_mirroring"></a>Coordinator Mirroring <a class="header-anchor" href="#coordinator-mirroring" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a id=&quot;coordinator_mirroring&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Coordinator Mirroring&quot;">​</a></h2><p>There are two coordinator instances in a highly available cluster, a <em>primary</em> and a <em>standby</em>. As with segments, the coordinator and standby should be deployed on different hosts so that the cluster can tolerate a single host failure. Clients connect to the primary coordinator and queries can be run only on the primary coordinator. The standby coordinator is kept up to date with the primary coordinator using Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)-based streaming replication. See <a href="./overview-of-coordinator-mirroring.html">Overview of Coordinator Mirroring</a>.</p><p>If the coordinator fails, the administrator runs the <code>gpactivatestandby</code> utility to have the standby coordinator take over as the new primary coordinator. You can configure a virtual IP address for the coordinator and standby so that client programs do not have to switch to a different network address when the current coordinator changes. If the coordinator host fails, the virtual IP address can be swapped to the actual acting coordinator.</p><h2 id="dual-clusters" tabindex="-1"><a id="dual_clusters"></a>Dual Clusters <a class="header-anchor" href="#dual-clusters" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a id=&quot;dual_clusters&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Dual Clusters&quot;">​</a></h2><p>An additional level of redundancy can be provided by maintaining two WarehousePG clusters, both storing the same data.</p><p>Two methods for keeping data synchronized on dual clusters are &quot;dual ETL&quot; and &quot;backup/restore.&quot;</p><p>Dual ETL provides a complete standby cluster with the same data as the primary cluster. ETL (extract, transform, and load) refers to the process of cleansing, transforming, validating, and loading incoming data into a data warehouse. With dual ETL, this process is run twice in parallel, once on each cluster, and is validated each time. It also allows data to be queried on both clusters, doubling the query throughput. Applications can take advantage of both clusters and also ensure that the ETL is successful and validated on both clusters.</p><p>To maintain a dual cluster with the backup/restore method, create backups of the primary cluster and restore them on the secondary cluster. This method takes longer to synchronize data on the secondary cluster than the dual ETL strategy, but requires less application logic to be developed. Populating a second cluster with backups is ideal in use cases where data modifications and ETL are performed daily or less frequently.</p><h2 id="backup-and-restore" tabindex="-1"><a id="backup_restore"></a>Backup and Restore <a class="header-anchor" href="#backup-and-restore" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a id=&quot;backup_restore&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Backup and Restore&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Making regular backups of the databases is recommended except in cases where the database can be easily regenerated from the source data. Backups should be taken to protect from operational, software, and hardware errors.</p><p>Use the <code>gpbackup</code> utility to backup WarehousePG. <code>gpbackup</code> performs the backup in parallel across segments, so backup performance scales up as hardware is added to the cluster.</p><p>When designing a backup strategy, a primary concern is where to store the backup data. The data each segment manages can be backed up on the segment&#39;s local storage, but should not be stored there permanently—the backup reduces disk space available to the segment and, more importantly, a hardware failure could simultaneously destroy the segment&#39;s live data and the backup. After performing a backup, the backup files should be moved from the primary cluster to separate, safe storage. Alternatively, the backup can be made directly to separate storage.</p><p>Using a WarehousePG storage plugin with the <code>gpbackup</code> and <code>gprestore</code> utilities, you can send a backup to, or retrieve a backup from a remote location or a storage appliance. WarehousePG storage plugins support connecting to locations including Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) compatbile locations such as Cloudian and Minio.</p><p>Using the Backup/Restore Storage Plugin API you can create a custom plugin that the <code>gpbackup</code> and <code>gprestore</code> utilities can use to integrate a custom backup storage system with the WarehousePG.</p><p>For information about using <code>gpbackup</code> and <code>gprestore</code>, see the documentation.</p><ul><li><p><strong><a href="./overview-of-segment-mirroring.html">Overview of Segment Mirroring</a></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><a href="./overview-of-coordinator-mirroring.html">Overview of Coordinator Mirroring</a></strong></p></li></ul><p><strong>Parent topic:</strong> <a href="./enabling-high-availability-features.html">Enabling High Availability and Data Consistency Features</a></p>',44)]))}const g=a(i,[["render",s]]);export{p as __pageData,g as default};
