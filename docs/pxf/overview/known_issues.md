description: Learn about known issues and configuration gotchas for PXF on WarehousePG.
---

This release includes the following known issues and limitations. Where applicable, workarounds are included to help mitigate the impact. These issues are actively tracked and are planned for resolution in a future release.

- If `fs.s3a.endpoint` in a server's site XML file doesn't include the URI scheme (`http://` or `https://`), PXF fails with a connection error such as `Unsupported or unrecognized SSL message`, and the PXF logs don't show additional detail. Always include the scheme in the endpoint value. See [S3-compatible object stores](../connecting/object-stores/s3.md).

- Third-party JDBC driver JARs placed in the global `$PXF_BASE/lib` directory can cause classloader conflicts with libraries PXF already ships. Place them in the server-specific directory (`$PXF_BASE/servers/<server_name>/`) instead, so PXF loads them in an isolated classloader.
