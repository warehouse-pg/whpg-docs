description: Configure PXF to read HBase table data and query it from WarehousePG.
---

Configure a server for HBase, then query its table data through external tables. PXF only supports reading from HBase, not writing to it.

## Configuring the server

Create a server that connects to an HBase cluster.

::: info Note
If you plan to filter on HBase external tables, copy `$PXF_HOME/share/pxf-hbase-*.jar` to every node in the HBase cluster first, and add its location to `$HBASE_CLASSPATH`. HBase's region servers need this JAR to execute a pushed-down filter.
:::

1. Create a server directory under `$PXF_BASE/servers`, and copy the `hbase-site.xml` template into it. For example, to configure a server named `hbase_server`:

    ```bash
    mkdir $PXF_BASE/servers/hbase_server
    cp $PXF_HOME/templates/hbase-site.xml $PXF_BASE/servers/hbase_server
    ```

1. Edit `hbase-site.xml` with your connection details:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <configuration>
        <property>
            <name>hbase.rootdir</name>
            <value>hdfs://<namenode_host>:<namenode_port>/hbase</value>
        </property>
        <property>
            <name>hbase.zookeeper.quorum</name>
            <value><zookeeper_host></value>
        </property>
    </configuration>
    ```

    Where:
    - `hbase.rootdir` is the location on HDFS where HBase stores its data.
    - `hbase.zookeeper.quorum` is the ZooKeeper ensemble HBase uses for coordination.

    See [Configuration templates](../../reference/configuration-templates.md#hbase-sitexml) for the full list of `hbase-site.xml` properties.

1. Sync the change to every segment host, then restart PXF to apply it:

    ```bash
    pxf cluster sync
    pxf cluster restart
    ```

## Reading data

PXF maps each HBase column to a `<column_family>:<qualifier>` column name. The following example reads an HBase table named `employees`, with `personal` and `job` column families, using the `hbase_server` server:

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE employee_hbase ("personal:name" text, "job:department" text, "job:salary" int)
    LOCATION ('pxf://employees?PROFILE=hbase&SERVER=hbase_server')
    FORMAT 'CUSTOM' (FORMATTER='pxfwritable_import');

SELECT * FROM employee_hbase;
```

WarehousePG (WHPG) caps column names at 63 characters and requires them to be character-based, while an HBase qualifier name can be longer or contain binary data. When a qualifier doesn't fit those rules, map it indirectly through a lookup table instead. Create a table named `pxflookup` in HBase with a single column family named `mapping`, then add a row per mapped qualifier, using the target HBase table's name as the row key and the WHPG column alias as the qualifier under `mapping`:

```
create 'pxflookup', 'mapping'
put 'pxflookup', 'employees', 'mapping:name', 'personal:name'
put 'pxflookup', 'employees', 'mapping:dept', 'job:department'
```

Reference the aliases directly as column names when you create the external table:

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE employee_hbase_mapped (name text, dept text)
    LOCATION ('pxf://employees?PROFILE=hbase&SERVER=hbase_server')
    FORMAT 'CUSTOM' (FORMATTER='pxfwritable_import');
```

Add a `recordkey bytea` column to also read the row's key, HBase's unique per-row identifier that isn't stored in any column family. Type it `text` instead of `bytea` if you want to filter on it in a `WHERE` clause and have that filter pushed down to HBase.
